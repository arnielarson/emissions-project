[Project Analysis]()

This analysis uses data from the EPA [National Emissions Inventory](http://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/eiinformation.html),
with pollutants, emissions, sources, year.  The data was curated and provided by Roger Peng as part of the [Exploraroty Data Analysis](https://class.coursera.org/exdata-033) course, and included [PM2.5](http://www.airinfonow.org/html/ed_particulate.html) type emissions data, (air pollutants that are less than 2.5 microns) from 1998 to 2011.  A second database was included to provide more detailed infromation for each emission measurement included in the inventory.  The goals for the analysis were to create exploratory graphs to answer the questions:


####Project Questions:
- have total emissions for PM2.5 decreased?
- have total emissions for PM2.5 decreased in Baltimore, MD?
- of the types of emissions, which have decreased or increased for Baltimore?
- accross the US, how have emissions changed for Coal Combustion related sources?
- How have emissions for motor vehicle sources (MVS) changed in Baltimore?
- How do emissions from motor vehicle sources compare between Baltimore and Los Angelas.
